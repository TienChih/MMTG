The words are sometimes called undefined terms, primitives or technical terms.  A set of statements called axioms that we assume to be true concerning the undefined terms.       A model of an axiom system is a set of meanings for the undefined terms. These meanings are assigned without any regard for whether the axioms become true statements about the undefined terms.     Consider the following axiom system, the 4 point geometry . Let point , line and belongs be the undefined terms. The axioms are:   There are 4 points.    Given two distinct points, there is exactly one line that they both belong to.    Each line has exactly two points belonging to it.   Then the following are models of this axiom system.

Justify your assertion.    Find a model that satisfies , and but not .    Find a model that satisfies , and in which at least two points belong to no line.    Prove or disprove: Each point belongs to a line.   Since such a geometry is fundamentally uninteresting, we add a fourth axiom.    For each pair of distinct points, there is at least one line they both belong to.     Let cards be points and SETs be lines. Does the grid you constructed in satisfy all four of our axioms? Justify your assertion.     Find the invalid line of the following proof .     By , there is a line , by , has two points, , . So for each point , there is a line containing .

Find a model that satisfies our axiom system in which there are two different points and such that at least two different lines each contain both and .   Since this axiom system still seems flawed, we replace the fourth axiom with a stronger version.    For each pair of distinct points, there is exactly one line they both belong to.     We let denote the line containing both and .    A collection of points are colinear if there are is a line which all the points in the collection belong to.    What would we mean by the statement that points are non-collinear?    Is it true that given a point that there exist two more points such that the three points are collinear? Prove your answer.
